## Good Will Gestures

## Mission Statement
We want to empower individuals to live a truly fulfilling life by reminding them to do good. Spread love - it's the only way.

## Overview
People want to do good and serve others, but it's just so hard to remember to do it. Even if you do remember, it's hard to think of a service idea on the spot. This application solves both problems by reminding you to serve - randomly choosing a person from your contacts, and giving you suggestions for how to serve them.

## Features:
1. Add, edit, and delete contacts to store your friends' information that could help you serve them better (like address, email, birthday, etc.)

2. Browse "good will gestures" AKA acts of service to spark ideas in how to serve your friends

3. Customize "good will gestures" by adding, editing, or deleting

4. Randomly generate a pair of one of your contacts with a "good will gesture", making it easy to serve
